## Installation
1. Make sure I have added you as a contributor to this project!
2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
3. When it is open, sign in with your GitHub account and authorise the connection.
4. There should be a clickable option to Clone this repository (_HPetch/DES203-Group-15_) on the right-hand side.
    - This will download the current version of the UE4 project to your computer, in whichever folder you want.
    - It will take a little while to download!
