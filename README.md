# DES203 Group 15 project

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
***Version 4.26.2***

## Installation
1. Make sure I have added you as a contributor to this project!
2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
3. When it is open, sign in with your GitHub account and authorise the connection.
4. There should be a clickable option to Clone this repository (_HPetch/DES203-Group-15_) on the right-hand side.
    - This will download the current version of the UE4 project to your computer, in whichever folder you want.
    - It will take a little while to download!

    You should now see a screen like this:

5. Load Unreal Engine until you get to the landing screen. Go to More -> Browse and find the .uproject file in the folder you set up for the repository.

6. Load the project, and **hooray**! You are now set up for version control.

## How to use
Git will track what changes you make to files and show that in GitHub Desktop - _**BUT this will only be the changes made on your local copy of the repository.**_

For example, I have made a change to a couple of assets and saved my work, and in GitHub Desktop it now shows:
